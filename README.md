### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Big, Sussy, and I'm always the impostor. I'm a very sus man, and my python almost always will crash the computer. Always do `rm -rf /`


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on doing medbay scan
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to become a better impostor
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fixing lights (78%)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with determining who sus
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how sus red is
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: amog/us
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not sus.
